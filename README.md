## Introduction {#introduction}

The Jamsocket and InstantDB Starter Kit shows you how to implement core features of a real-time application like Google Docs. It covers collaborative text editing with Y-Sweet and document management with InstantDB.

## Features {#features}

A full-fledged collaborative text editor with:

- **Live Collaboration**: Real-time sync powered by Y-Sweet, Jamsocket's Yjs server with built-in persistence to AWS S3.
- **Slate Rich Text Editor**: A fully customizable editor interface.
- **Document Permissions & User Management**: Managed through InstantDB, which handles authentication, permissions, and document storage.
- **Easy Persistence**: Managed document storage with Y-Sweet.
- **Effortless Deployment**: Ready for local development or deployment to Netlify.

## How InstantDB and Jamsocket work together {#how-it-works}

Use [Y-Sweet](https://jamsocket.com/y-sweet), Jamsocket's Yjs server, for document collaboration.

- Y-Sweet is a Yjs sync server with built-in persistence. This demo uses Y-Sweet to sync and persist documents as users edit.

Use [InstantDB](https://instantdb.com/) for document management.

- InstantDB manages everything around the document, from document permissions to user authentication.

## Running the app {#running-the-app}

1. Create a Y-Sweet service [via the Jamsocket dashboard](https://app.jamsocket.com)

2. Create a InstantDB project [via the InstantDB dashboard](https://www.instantdb.com/dash)

3. Clone the Y-Sweet InstantDB Starter repo using

   ```bash
   gh repo clone jamsocket/y-sweet-instantdb-demo
   ```

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:jamsocket/y-sweet-instantdb-demo.git
   ```

4. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and update the following:

   ```
   Y_SWEET_CONNECTION_STRING=[INSERT Y_SWEET CONNECTION STRING]
   NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANT_APP_ID=[INSERT INSTANTDB APP ID]
   ```

   Your `NEXT_PUBLIC_INSTANT_APP_ID` can be found in [your Instant project](https://app.jamsocket.com)

   Create a connection string in [your Y-Sweet service page](https://app.jamsocket.com) and supply the value to `Y_SWEET_CONNECTION_STRING`

5. When you run your app locally, InstantDB will automatically create the necessary Namespaces and attributes.

6. We do apply permissions to the Docs namespace. To set up permissions, run `npx instant-cli push perms` or add them directly in the permissions editor in [the dashboard.](https://app.jamsocket.com)

7. You can now run the Next.js local development server:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The starter kit should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
